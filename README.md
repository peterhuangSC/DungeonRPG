2D Role Player Dungeon Game

Hey fellas, this is a 2D role playing game that can be played directly from your terminal. This game is like the
dungeon crawler 3000 game, where the goal is to score the most points before advancing through all of the floors
in the game or slain. You have 5 hero choices, and you fight against a variety of chamber crawlers in each floor.
Enemies (Chamber crawlers) drop coins which contribute to your total score, and unknown potions are scattered 
across the map - which may assist your adventures.

Notice: You may view the code and compile/run it to play the game, but you may NOT copy this code for any school
assignment and related purposes. This includes any final projects at your institution (e.g. CS246 at UW). The university
has a program to check for code similarity (not just naming convention), such as code blocks, structures, and runtime.
Eg. you can check out MOSS (what Stanford uses) for your reference.
